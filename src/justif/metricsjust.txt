*Regression*
- deals with predicting continuous values.
- output: real number
- model learns to map input features to this continuous output.
*Classification*
- deals with assigning data points to predefined categories.
- output : output variable is discrete and represents a class label
- performance metrics : accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.


Regression performance metrics :
1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
   - The average absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.
   - Formula: MAE = (1/n) * Σ |y_i - ŷ_i|

2. Mean Squared Error (MSE):
   - The average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.
   - Formula: MSE = (1/n) * Σ (y_i - ŷ_i)^2

3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
   - The square root of the MSE, providing a measure in the original unit of the target variable.
   - Formula: RMSE = √MSE

4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):
   - Expresses errors as a percentage of the actual values.
   - Formula: MAPE = (1/n) * Σ |(y_i - ŷ_i)/y_i| * 100

5. (R-squared (Coefficient of Determination):)
   - Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
   - Ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.
   - Formula: R^2 = 1 - Σ (y_i - ŷ_i)^2 / Σ (y_i - ȳ)^2, where ȳ is the mean of the actual values.

6. (Explained Variance Score (EVS):)
   - Similar to R-squared, it measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
   - Ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.
   - Formula: EVS = 1 - Var(y - ŷ) / Var(y)

7. (Max Error:)
   - The maximum absolute error between predicted and actual values.
   - Formula: Max Error = max(|y_i - ŷ_i|)

8. (Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE):)
   - The mean of the logarithmic differences between predicted and actual values.
   - Particularly useful when the target variable has exponential growth.
   - Formula: MSLE = (1/n) * Σ (log(1 + y_i) - log(1 + ŷ_i))^2


I have strange results for MAE, MAPE, MSE, don't know how to interpret it.
